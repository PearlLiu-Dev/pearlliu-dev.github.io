This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Hello! I am a graduate student in Dr. Zhiyuan Chen's lab at Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center. I earned my bachelor's degree in Plant Science and Technology in China, but after developing new interests and being affected by the pandemic, I shifted my focus to biomedical research. Following my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant in Dr. Pengcheng Buâ€™s lab at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I assisted with gut tissue sectioning and cell culture. After that, I moved to the U.S. to continue my research journey.
As a rotation student, I worked in Dr. Bruce Aronow's lab, where I integrated and analyzed public single-cell datasets from organoids. I also rotated in Dr. Takanori Takebe's lab, where I learned to culture and differentiate human-induced pluripotent stem cells.
As a longtime fan of the Alien movie series, I'm fascinated by how life forms intricate organs and structures, develops into fully functioning organisms, and carries out complex physiological processes. Currently, in the Chen lab, Iâ€™m investigating the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of early embryonic development, using mouse IVF, gene editing, and low-input next-generation sequencing.

I enjoy the inner peace that comes from benchwork, and I also appreciate how programming sharpens my logical thinking. So, I am striving to become a developmental biologist who can integrate both dry lab and wet lab techniques. By utilizing in vivo, in vitro, and in silico models and techniques, I aim to uncover more mysteries of early developmental processes.
